# Progress: Alpha Vantage MCP Server

## What Works

- The core implementation of the MCP server is complete, covering the specified Alpha Vantage API categories and endpoints.
- The project structure is modular, mirroring the reference MCP indicators repository.
- Tools are implemented with Zod schemas for input validation.
- Native fetch is used for API requests.
- Environment variable for API key management is in place.
- Registration and index files are set up to include the implemented tools.
- `package.json` has been improved with proper scripts (build, start, lint, format, test, typecheck), metadata, and devDependencies.
- A `LICENSE` file has been added.
- The project builds successfully after fixing TypeScript errors related to unused parameters and imports.
- The `README.md` file has been created with comprehensive project documentation.
- Tool descriptions and JSDoc comments have been reviewed and appear clear and accurate.
- The `newsSentiment.ts` tool schema and parameter descriptions have been enhanced based on documentation.
- An LRU cache has been implemented for tool responses using `lru-cache`, with configurable TTLs per tool, integrated into `wrapToolHandler.ts`.

## What's Left to Build

- Full end-to-end testing of all implemented tools, including verifying the caching mechanism.
- Comprehensive documentation (README, detailed tool descriptions), including details about the caching.
- Potential future extensions with additional Alpha Vantage endpoints or custom logic as needed.
- Implementation of automated tests using a specified framework, including tests for the caching logic.

## Current Status

The project infrastructure has been improved with updated `package.json`, added `LICENSE`, and verified build process. Comprehensive documentation in `README.md` has been created, and tool descriptions have been reviewed. The `newsSentiment.ts` tool schema and descriptions were enhanced, and the Git push issue was corrected, ensuring changes are on the `master` branch. The LRU cache has been successfully integrated. The initial implementation is complete and the project is ready for the next phase of testing and automated test implementation, with a specific focus on verifying the caching behavior.

## Known Issues

- None explicitly mentioned in the initial task description. Any issues discovered during testing or further development should be documented here.
- There are expected linting warnings related to `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` as configured in `eslint.config.js`.
