## Project Progress: Alpha Vantage MCP Server

### What Works

-   **Core Tool Implementation**: All Alpha Vantage API functions listed in `src/tools/index.ts` have corresponding tool handlers implemented.
    -   Each tool handler correctly fetches data from the Alpha Vantage API.
    -   Input schemas (`inputSchemaShape`) are defined for each tool using Zod.
    -   Error handling is implemented for API request failures and Alpha Vantage API errors.
    -   CSV response handling has been removed; all tools now expect and process JSON.
    -   The `datatype` parameter is hardcoded to `json` for all tools.
-   **`insider_transactions` Tool Enhancements**:
    -   The tool now supports optional `startDate` and `endDate` parameters (YYYY-MM-DD format) for filtering transactions by date.
    -   Filtering logic is implemented client-side within the tool's handler as the API does not support native date filtering for this endpoint.
-   **`historical_options` Tool Enhancements**:
    -   The tool now supports optional `strike_price_proximity_count`, `current_stock_price`, `expiration_months_offset`, `min_open_interest`, `min_volume`, and `option_type` parameters for filtering options data.
    -   Filtering logic is implemented client-side within the tool's handler as the API does not support native filtering for these parameters.
    -   `bignumber.js` is used for precise numerical comparisons during filtering.
-   **Caching Mechanism**:
    -   An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache is implemented in `src/cacheService.ts`.
    -   The `wrapToolHandler` in `src/tools/wrapToolHandler.ts` uses this cache service.
    -   Cache keys are generated based on the tool name and its input parameters.
    -   Successful API responses are cached.
    -   Subsequent identical requests retrieve data from the cache, bypassing an API call, until the cache entry expires or is evicted.
    -   Cache configuration (TTL, max items) is defined in `src/cacheConfig.ts`.
-   **Project Structure**:
    -   Tools are organized into categories (stocks, crypto, indicators, etc.) within the `src/tools` directory.
    -   Each category has an `index.ts` to export its tools.
    -   The main `src/tools/index.ts` aggregates all tools.
-   **Build Process**: The project can be built using `npm run build` (which executes `tsc`).
-   **Linting and Formatting**: ESLint and Prettier are configured and can be run with `npm run lint` and `npm format`.

### What's Left to Build / Improve

-   **Comprehensive Testing**:
    -   **Unit Tests**:
        -   For each tool handler, focusing on:
            -   Correct API request formation.
            -   Successful response parsing.
            -   Correct handling of API errors (e.g., invalid symbol, API key issues).
            -   Correct handling of network errors.
            -   Correct functionality of the new date filtering in `insider_transactions`.
        -   For the `CacheService` (`src/cacheService.ts`):
            -   Verify `get`, `set`, and `has` methods.
            -   Test cache expiration (TTL).
            -   Test cache eviction (max items).
        -   For `wrapToolHandler` (`src/tools/wrapToolHandler.ts`):
            -   Verify that it correctly calls the underlying tool handler.
            -   Verify that it correctly uses the cache (stores new results, retrieves cached results).
            -   Verify error propagation from the tool handler.
    -   **Integration Tests**:
        -   Test the end-to-end flow of making a request through the MCP server (simulated) to a tool and receiving a response, including cache interaction.
-   **Refine Output Types**:
    -   Currently, many tool handlers use `any` as their `Output` type. These should be refined with specific Zod schemas or TypeScript interfaces based on the actual structure of the Alpha Vantage API responses for each endpoint. This will improve type safety and developer experience.
-   **API Key Management**:
    -   The API key is currently passed directly to handlers. Consider more secure ways to manage and provide the API key if this were a production application (e.g., environment variables, configuration service). For the current MCP context, this is acceptable.
-   **Documentation**:
    -   Ensure all tool descriptions and parameter descriptions in the Zod schemas are clear, accurate, and provide good examples where necessary.
    -   Update `README.md` with detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and test the MCP server, and how to use the available tools.
-   **Error Handling Granularity**:
    -   Improve the specificity of error messages thrown by tools to provide more context to the user/client.
-   **Logging**:
    -   Implement more structured logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.

### Current Status

-   The MCP server is functional, with all defined Alpha Vantage tools implemented and basic caching in place.
-   The `insider_transactions` tool has been enhanced with date filtering capabilities.
-   The `historical_options` tool has been enhanced with filtering capabilities.
-   The immediate next steps involve writing comprehensive tests for all components, particularly the caching mechanism and the new filtering.

### Known Issues

-   None explicitly identified at this moment, but comprehensive testing is needed to uncover potential bugs.
-   The `analytics_fixed_window` and `analytics_sliding_window` tools have complex input structures (arrays for `range` and `calculations`) that need careful testing.
