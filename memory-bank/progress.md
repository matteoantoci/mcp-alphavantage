## Project Progress: Alpha Vantage MCP Server

### What Works

- **Core Tool Implementation**: All Alpha Vantage API functions listed in `src/tools/index.ts` have corresponding tool handlers implemented.
    - Each tool handler correctly fetches data from the Alpha Vantage API via a shared `AlphaVantageClient` instance.
    - Input schemas (`inputSchemaShape`) are defined for each tool using Zod.
    - Error handling is implemented for API request failures and Alpha Vantage API errors.
    - CSV response handling has been removed; all tools now expect and process JSON.
    - The `datatype` parameter is hardcoded to `json` for all tools.
- **`insider_transactions` Tool Enhancements**:
    - The tool now supports optional `startDate` and `endDate` parameters (YYYY-MM-DD format) for filtering transactions by date.
    - Filtering logic is implemented client-side within the tool's handler as the API does not support native date filtering for this endpoint.
- **`historical_options` Tool Enhancements**:
    - The tool now supports optional `strike_price_proximity_count`, `current_stock_price`, `expiration_months_offset`, `min_open_interest`, `min_volume`, and `option_type` parameters for filtering options data.
    - Filtering logic is implemented client-side within the tool's handler as the API does not support native filtering for these parameters.
    - `bignumber.js` is used for precise numerical comparisons during filtering.
- **Centralized Caching Mechanism**:
    - An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache is now implemented at the `AlphaVantageClient` level (`src/alphaVantageClient.ts`).
    - All tool handlers use the shared client, which manages caching based solely on API parameters.
    - This prevents redundant cache entries due to client-side filters and maximizes cache efficiency across all tools.
    - The previous cache service (`src/cacheService.ts`) and caching in `wrapToolHandler.ts` have been removed.
    - Cache configuration (TTL, max items) is defined in the client.
- **Project Structure**:
    - Tools are organized into categories (stocks, crypto, indicators, etc.) within the `src/tools` directory.
    - Each category has an `index.ts` to export its tools.
    - The main `src/tools/index.ts` aggregates all tools.
- **Build Process**: The project can be built using `npm run build` (which executes `tsc`).
- **Linting and Formatting**: ESLint and Prettier are configured and can be run with `npm run lint` and `npm format`.

### What's Left to Build / Improve

- **Comprehensive Testing**:
    - **Unit Tests**:
        - For each tool handler, focusing on:
            - Correct API request formation.
            - Successful response parsing.
            - Correct handling of API errors (e.g., invalid symbol, API key issues).
            - Correct handling of network errors.
            - Correct functionality of the new date filtering in `insider_transactions`.
        - For the `AlphaVantageClient`:
            - Verify `get`, `set`, and `has` methods of the LRU cache.
            - Test cache expiration (TTL).
            - Test cache eviction (max items).
        - For `wrapToolHandler`:
            - Verify that it correctly calls the underlying tool handler.
            - Verify error propagation from the tool handler.
    - **Integration Tests**:
        - Test the end-to-end flow of making a request through the MCP server (simulated) to a tool and receiving a response, including cache interaction.
- **Refine Output Types**:
    - Currently, many tool handlers use `any` as their `Output` type. These should be refined with specific Zod schemas or TypeScript interfaces based on the actual structure of the Alpha Vantage API responses for each endpoint. This will improve type safety and developer experience.
- **API Key Management**:
    - The API key is now managed by the client and injected into all handlers. Consider more secure ways to manage and provide the API key if this were a production application (e.g., environment variables, configuration service). For the current MCP context, this is acceptable.
- **Documentation**:
    - Ensure all tool descriptions and parameter descriptions in the Zod schemas are clear, accurate, and provide good examples where necessary.
    - Update `README.md` with detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and test the MCP server, and how to use the available tools.
    - Update `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md` to document the new client/caching architecture.
- **Error Handling Granularity**:
    - Improve the specificity of error messages thrown by tools to provide more context to the user/client.
- **Logging**:
    - Implement more structured logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.

### Current Status

- The MCP server is functional, with all defined Alpha Vantage tools implemented and now using a centralized client and cache.
- The `insider_transactions` tool has been enhanced with date filtering capabilities.
- The `historical_options` tool has been enhanced with filtering capabilities.
- The client-level cache refactor is complete and all tools have been migrated to the new architecture.
- The immediate next steps involve writing comprehensive tests for all components, particularly the new client-level caching mechanism and the new filtering.

### Known Issues

- None explicitly identified at this moment, but comprehensive testing is needed to uncover potential bugs.
- The `analytics_fixed_window` and `analytics_sliding_window` tools have complex input structures (arrays for `range` and `calculations`) that need careful testing.
