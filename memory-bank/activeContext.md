# Active Context: Alpha Vantage MCP Server

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on improving project infrastructure, including `package.json`, linting, building, and licensing, as part of the broader documentation and quality assurance phase.

## Recent Changes

- Scaffolded the `memory-bank` directory and populated initial core files.
- Improved `package.json` with proper scripts (build, start, lint, format, test, typecheck), metadata, and devDependencies.
- Added a `LICENSE` file.
- Fixed TypeScript build errors related to unused parameters and imports in tool handler and definition files.
- Enhanced the `newsSentiment.ts` tool schema and parameter descriptions based on documentation.
- Corrected Git push to ensure changes were applied to the `master` branch and removed an erroneously created `main` branch on the remote.
- Implemented an LRU cache for tool responses using `lru-cache`, with configurable TTLs per tool.

## Next Steps

- Continue with the plan outlined in the previous PLAN MODE response, focusing on:
    - End-to-end testing of all implemented tools, including verifying the caching mechanism.
    - Comprehensive documentation (README, tool descriptions), including details about the caching.
    - Potential future extensions.
    - Implementation of automated tests, including tests for the caching logic.
- Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the current status and completed tasks.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensuring the Memory Bank accurately reflects the project's current state and history is crucial for effective future work.
- The project now has basic linting and build configurations in place.
- The LRU cache has been successfully integrated into the tool handling process.
- The next phase will heavily involve testing and further documentation, with a specific focus on verifying the caching behavior.
