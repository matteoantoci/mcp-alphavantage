# Active Context: Alpha Vantage MCP Server

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on improving project infrastructure, including `package.json`, linting, building, and licensing, as part of the broader documentation and quality assurance phase.

## Recent Changes

- Scaffolded the `memory-bank` directory and populated initial core files.
- Improved `package.json` with proper scripts (build, start, lint, format, test, typecheck), metadata, and devDependencies.
- Added a `LICENSE` file.
- Fixed TypeScript build errors related to unused parameters and imports in tool handler and definition files.

## Next Steps

- Continue with the plan outlined in the previous PLAN MODE response, focusing on:
    - End-to-end testing of all implemented tools.
    - Comprehensive documentation (README, tool descriptions).
    - Potential future extensions.
    - Implementation of automated tests.
- Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the current status and completed tasks.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensuring the Memory Bank accurately reflects the project's current state and history is crucial for effective future work.
- The project now has basic linting and build configurations in place.
- The next phase will heavily involve testing and further documentation.
