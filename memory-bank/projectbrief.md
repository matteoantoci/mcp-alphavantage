# Project Brief: Alpha Vantage MCP Server

This project aims to design and implement an MCP server for interacting with the Alpha Vantage API. The server is built to provide access to various financial data endpoints, following a modular and scalable architecture based on an existing MCP indicators repository.

## Core Requirements & Goals

- Implement an MCP server using TypeScript and the @modelcontextprotocol/sdk.
- Integrate with the Alpha Vantage API to fetch financial data.
- Focus on the following Alpha Vantage API categories:
    - Core Stocks
    - Options Data
    - Alpha Intelligence
    - Fundamental Data
    - Trending Technical Indicators (excluding premium endpoints)
- Use Zod for input schema validation for each tool.
- Utilize native fetch for making HTTP requests to the Alpha Vantage API.
- Manage the Alpha Vantage API key securely using an environment variable (`ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY`).
- Exclude premium Alpha Vantage endpoints and non-trending technical indicators.
- Structure the project modularly, with each API group and endpoint implemented as a separate tool.
- Ensure tools handle both JSON and CSV responses and provide appropriate error handling.
- Maintain up-to-date registration and index files for tools.

## Project Scope

The initial scope covers the implementation of the specified Alpha Vantage API categories and their respective endpoints as individual MCP tools. Future extensions may include adding more endpoints, custom logic, automated tests, and deployment procedures.
