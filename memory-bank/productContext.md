# Product Context: Alpha Vantage MCP Server

## Why this project exists

This project exists to provide a structured and standardized way for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to access financial data from the Alpha Vantage API. By creating an MCP server, we enable other MCP-compatible agents and systems to easily integrate with Alpha Vantage data without needing to handle API specifics directly.

## Problems it solves

- **Simplifies Alpha Vantage API access:** Abstracts away the complexities of the Alpha Vantage API, providing a clean tool interface.
- **Standardizes financial data access:** Fits Alpha Vantage data into the MCP framework, making it interoperable with other MCP tools and resources.
- **Enables automated financial analysis:** Allows agents to programmatically fetch and analyze financial data for various tasks.

## How it should work

The server should expose Alpha Vantage endpoints as distinct MCP tools. Each tool should:
- Define its input parameters using a Zod schema for validation.
- Handle the API request to Alpha Vantage.
- Process the API response (JSON or CSV).
- Return the data in a structured format suitable for MCP.
- Provide clear error handling for API limits, network issues, or invalid inputs.

## User experience goals

- **Ease of use:** Agents should be able to understand and use the tools with minimal effort, relying on the tool schemas and descriptions.
- **Reliability:** The server should handle API interactions robustly and provide informative feedback on success or failure.
- **Discoverability:** Tools should be well-documented and easily discoverable within the MCP ecosystem.
